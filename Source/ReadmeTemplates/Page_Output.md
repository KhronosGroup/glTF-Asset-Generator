The models are split into two categories, Positive and Negative, to help differentiate the result should be expected when loading a models.

## What is the difference between positive and negative?
A positive test is when the test is designed to return what is expected according to the specification. A negative test is when the test is designed to determine the response of the product outside of what is defined.

In this case, all of the positive tests are valid models per the glTF specification, while the negative tests are invalid models.
