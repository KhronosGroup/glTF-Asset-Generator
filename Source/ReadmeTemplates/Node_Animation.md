These models are intended to test the basic attributes of the node object.  

Every model has three nodes. Node 0 is usable as a point of reference. Node 1 is a child of node 0 and is where transforms are applied.  
Node 2 is a child of node 1 and will receive the same transformations by inheritance.  

The following table shows the properties that are set for a given model.
