These models are intended to test the various properties that can be applied to a primitive.  

The mesh of the base model is split into two primitives, and then primitive attributes are set on both primitives.

Both primitives are using the same index values, but have different vertex positions.  
They are positioned next to each other so that together they appear to be a square plane.

The following table shows the properties that are set for a given model.
