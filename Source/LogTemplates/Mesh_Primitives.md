Both primitives have different UV values and use UV 0.  
Otherwise, no attributes are explicitly set in every model generated by this test, other than those in the base model.

Both primitives are using the same index values, but have different vertex positions.  
They are positioned next to each other so that together they appear to be a square plane.
