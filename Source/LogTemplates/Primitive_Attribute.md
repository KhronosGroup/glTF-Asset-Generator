These models are intended to test the attributes that can be applied to a primitive.  

No attributes are explicitly set in every model generated by this test, other than those in the base model.  

If both Vertex UV 0 and 1 are set on a model, then all of the textures will use Vertex UV 1.

All values of Byte and Short are normalized unsigned.

The following table shows the properties that are set for a given model.
