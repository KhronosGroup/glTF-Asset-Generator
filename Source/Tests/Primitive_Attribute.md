No attributes are explicitly set in every model generated by this test, other than those in the base model.  

If both Vertex UV 1 and 2 are set on a model, then only values for Vertex UV 2 are used by the textures.  
Vertex UV 1 maps the entire texture to the model, while Vertex UV 2 only maps the top corner to the model.
