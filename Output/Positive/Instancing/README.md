These models are intended to test instancing of various attributes.  
 
The following table shows the properties that are set for a given model.

| [06](Instancing_06.gltf)<br>[View](https://bghgary.github.io/glTF-Assets-Viewer/?type=Positive&folder=24&model=6) | [<img src="Figures/Thumbnails/Instancing_06.png" align="middle">](Figures/SampleImages/Instancing_06.png) | Two nodes using the same `mesh` attribute. | The node viewed on the left has a `translation` to the left on the X axis.<br><br>The node viewed on the right has a `translation` to the right on the X axis. |
| [07](Instancing_07.gltf)<br>[View](https://bghgary.github.io/glTF-Assets-Viewer/?type=Positive&folder=24&model=7) | [<img src="Figures/Thumbnails/Instancing_07.png" align="middle">](Figures/SampleImages/Instancing_07.png) | Two nodes using the same `skin` attribute. | The mesh viewed on the left has `POSITION` values further on the left of the X axis.<br><br>The mesh viewed to the right has values further on the right of the X axis. |
| [08](Instancing_08.gltf)<br>[View](https://bghgary.github.io/glTF-Assets-Viewer/?type=Positive&folder=24&model=8) | [<img src="Figures/Thumbnails/Instancing_08.png" align="middle">](Figures/SampleImages/Instancing_08.png) | Two skins using the same `joints` attributes. | The skin viewed on the left has `inverseBindMatrices` that stand the model up and fold it slightly.<br><br>The values viewed on the right are similar, but fold the model twice as much. |
| [09](Instancing_09.gltf)<br>[View](https://bghgary.github.io/glTF-Assets-Viewer/?type=Positive&folder=24&model=9) | [<img src="Figures/Thumbnails/Instancing_09.png" align="middle">](Figures/SampleImages/Instancing_09.png) | Two skins using the same `inverseBindMatrices` attribute. | The base joint for the skin viewed on the left has a `translation` to the left along the X axis.<br><br>The base joint viewed to the right has a `translation` to the right along the X axis. |
| [10](Instancing_10.gltf)<br>[View](https://bghgary.github.io/glTF-Assets-Viewer/?type=Positive&folder=24&model=10) | [<img src="Figures/Thumbnails/Instancing_10.gif" align="middle">](Figures/SampleImages/Instancing_10.gif) | Two animation channels using the same `sampler` attribute. | The first animation channel targets the node viewed on the left.<br><br>The second targets the node viewed on the right. |
