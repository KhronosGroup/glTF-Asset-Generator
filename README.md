## What is this project?
This is a C# Visual Studio project for generating various glTF 2.0 assets for validating glTF 2.0 importers.

## Why was it created?
In order to help ensure that glTF 2.0 importers meet the [glTF 2.0 Specification](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0) requirements, various types of asset files would need to be created that cover different aspects of the specification. This project is intended to create these various models.

## What does it currently cover?
So far, this project covers these requirements, with more to come:
- [Material](Output/Material/README.md)
- [Material Alpha Blend](Output/Material_AlphaBlend/README.md)
- [Material Alpha Mask](Output/Material_AlphaMask/README.md)
- [Material Double Sided](Output/Material_DoubleSided/README.md)
- [Material Metallic Roughness](Output/Material_MetallicRoughness/README.md)
- [Material Mixed](Output/Material_Mixed/README.md)
- [Material Specular Glossiness](Output/Material_SpecularGlossiness/README.md)
 

## Will it cover anything else?
