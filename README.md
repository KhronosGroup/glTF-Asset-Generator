## What is this project?
This is a C# Visual Studio project for generating various glTF 2.0 assets for validating glTF 2.0 importers.

## Why was it created?
In order to help ensure that glTF 2.0 importers meet the [glTF 2.0 Specification](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0) requirements, various types of asset files would need to be created that cover different aspects of the specification .  This project is intended to create these various models.

## What does it currently cover?
So far, this project covers these requirements, with more to come:
- [Materials](Output/Material/README.md)
- [Material Alphas](Output/Material_Alpha/README.md)
- [Primitive Attributes](Output/Primitive_Attribute/README.md)
- [Texture Samplers](Output/Texture_Sampler/README.md)
- [Metallic Roughness](Output/Material_MetallicRoughness/README.md)
- [Specular Glossiness](Output/Material_SpecularGlossiness/README.md)
- [Mesh Indices](Output/Mesh_Indices/README.md)
- [Mesh Primitives](Output/Mesh_Primitives/README.md)
- [Mesh Primitives UV](Output/Mesh_PrimitivesUV/README.md)
- [Compatibility](Output/Compatibility/README.md)
